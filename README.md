**DOCUMENTATION MUST BE DONE.**

GSMath provides a mathematical library (linear algebra, algebra, analysis, etc).
It's mostly developed in OCaml, and a python version is in development.

The goal of GSMath is to provide the same library in multiple languages, with
the same algorithms.
Each language has his own branch.
- edo (RK4, Newton)
- interpolation
- root finding
- matrix
- trigonometry
- vector module
- integral calculus
